# Testing in Ember

## Abstract

Unit, Integration, Acceptance, which one? How do I test this one thing? Should tests cover everything? How do I use this Grand Testing Unification thing? If you've asked yourself these questions you might want a pep talk.

I'm here to run through several common testing scenarios and show what level each works well. You will learn concepts like nested modules (QUnit), async/await/try/catch patterns, mocks and spies, and Unit vs Integration vs Application testing.
